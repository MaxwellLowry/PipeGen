# PipeGen

PipeGen – Parametric Pipe Generator

PipeGen is a parametric pipe generator I developed using PicoGK. I first discovered PicoGK several months ago when I saw a video of LEAP71 hot-firing a metal 3D-printed rocket engine. I learned that they generate complex geometries computationally, which inspired me to explore computational engineering for myself.

This project is a basic exploration of computational design, demonstrating how complex geometries can be generated without standard CAD tools.

Resources

This project relied on several resources:

PicoGK – the core geometry kernel used to generate the pipe geometries.
Lin Kayser and Josefine Lissner’s GitHub pages – examples and guidance for computational geometry.
ChatGPT – to help brainstorm solutions to coding challenges.
Lin Kayser’s book, Coding for Engineers – an ongoing resource I found helpful while learning computational design.

About Me

I am a sophomore Engineering Physics student at The Ohio State University. This is my first project in C#. I have prior experience coding in MATLAB and Python.
